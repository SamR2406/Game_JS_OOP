Quick path to finish the current build:

1. `yes` — respond to the opening plea so the connection activates.
2. `left` — step into the Music Room.
3. `search` — grab the Gold Key (and sword) from the piano benches.
4. `back` — return to the Front Living Room.
5. `front` — unlock and enter the Mirror Hall using the Gold Key.
6. `mirror` — press into the giant mirror and trigger the finale.
