2. `left` — step into the Music Room.
3. `search` — grab the Gold Key (and sword) from the piano benches.
4. `back` — return to the Front Living Room.
5. `front` — unlock and enter the Mirror Hall using the Gold Key.
6. `mirror` — press into the giant mirror and trigger the finale.

Good ending (shatter the mimic) quick path:

5. `back` — return to the Front Living Room.
6. `front` — unlock and enter the Mirror Hall with the Gold Key.
7. `break the mirror` — type the command while in Mirror Hall to destroy the skin-walker and see the good ending.
